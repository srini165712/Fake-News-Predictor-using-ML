# Fake-News-Predictor-using-ML
## A ML model that determines whether a news is fake or real
### I have used a Logistic Regression Model, Stemming Algorithm and Stopwords to impove efficiency of classification.
  #### Stemming : A process to get only root words 
  #### Stopwords : Any word in a stop list which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data
### This process ensures that we consider only significant words thus helping to normalize our datasets
